# CS310-tictactoe
  
    This program is created to serve as a replica of the classic game of tic-tac-toe.
  It provides a GUI version of the game for easier and more simplified gameplay between two challengers.
  The classes implemeted in this project, which are: TicTacToe.java, TicTacToeModel.java, and TicTacToeView.java 
  each have their own purposes that when compiled and ran create an easy to play version of tic-tac-toe. 
  The TicTacToeView class takes advantage of the javaswing library to implement a GUI version of the game for the
  people playing it.  This makes playing the game more simple and easier than having to play from the command prompt
  and manually enter each of the coordinates for where you may want to place your move.  
  After successful completion of the game, the GUI will display the winner, whether it be the X player or the O player, 
  and promptly ask if you would like to start a new game.  If you are done playing the game of tic-tac-toe, then
  you can close the GUI and the program will exit.
